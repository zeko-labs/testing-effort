# Zeko Testing

You can test Zeko by using it the exact same way you'd use Mina.
If you have any questions/issues, please ask in the [Discord]() or make an issue on this repository.

- Install [Auro wallet](https://www.aurowallet.com/) or install [Pallad wallet](https://pallad.co)
- Add Zeko devnet to your wallet. You can add it manually too as ,https://devnet.zeko.io/graphql>.

## Faucet

You can get funds from <https://zeko.io/faucet>.

NB: If you get
```
Error occured: Transaction failed with errors: - {"statusCode":200,"statusText":"\"[[],[[\\\"Cancelled\\\"]],[[\\\"Account_balance_precondition_unsatisfied\\\"]]]\""}
```
that means you’ve already been fauceted.
Error message just hasn’t been cleaned up.

Check that your wallet is fauceted using Zekoscan (https://zekoscan.io/devnet/home), by pasting your wallet address in the search bar, and selecting ‘zkApp Transactions’.

Note, you can also check that your balance has been updated in your wallet, and you’ll receive a success confirmation on the Faucet page.

## Use Zeko

You can try sending funds or using any deployed zkApps if you can find any.

If you are a developer, you can deploy your zkApp as you would on Mina.
See <https://docs.zeko.io/for_zkapp_developers>.
